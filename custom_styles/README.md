# Enhanced Ability Description Styling

This folder contains enhanced styling code for the ability descriptions in your Chess-in-Chess game.

## How to Implement

1. Find the `updateAbilityDescription` and `resetAbilityDescription` methods in your `mainwindow.cpp` file
2. Replace them with the enhanced versions in `ability_styles.cpp`
3. Note that the enhanced styles might need an image resource for full effect:
   - If you want to use a background image, add an image to your resource file (e.g., `parchment_bg.png`)
   - If you don't have a background image, simply remove that line from the stylesheet

## Styling Features

The enhanced styling includes:

- Book Antiqua font with fantasy styling
- Dark gradient background with border
- Gold accents and decorative symbols
- Structured layout with header and footer
- Enhanced bullet points with special symbols
- Proper formatting for different sections

## Default State

When no abilities are shown (waiting for a piece capture), the panel will display:

- A decorative header
- A message instructing the user to capture a piece
- Decorative symbols
- Footer with fleur-de-lis symbols
